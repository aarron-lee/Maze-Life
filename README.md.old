## MVP

This project will visually show path traversal algorithms through a randomly generated maze. I plan on implementing a naive recursive backtracking algorithm for maze creation, and implement a visual showing DFS, BFS, and if time allows, A* search.

## Technlogies, Libraries, APIs

I plan on using vanilla ES6 Javascript, HTML, and CSS, for to implement this project. I'll need Webpack for to provide Babel transpilers for to ensure ES6 compatibility.

## Implementation Timeline

Day 1

- Setup dependencies
- Create basic maze canvas
- Implement recursive maze generator

Day 2
- Finish previous day materials
- Implement DFS traversal, and corresponding visual elements

Day 3
- Implement BFS traversal, and corresponding visual elements
- Add finishing touches and visuals
- If time allows, implement A* search
